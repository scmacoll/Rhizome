## Rhizome

The complexity of manually entering small datasets into graph databases like Neo4j presents a significant barrier, akin to the widespread preference for the intuitive simplicity of spreadsheet software over direct SQL database manipulation. Rhizome simplifies this by transforming tabular inputs into queries suitable for graph databases, and further enhances search and querying capabilities through LLM. This approach makes both the input and discovery of related data as straightforward as using a spreadsheet.
